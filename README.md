**Biomes O' Plenty** is a **Minecraft mod** that adds **over 50 new biomes** to the overworld and Nether. From coral reefs to bamboo forests, all of our biomes are decorated with a slew of **new plants, trees, flowers, and more!**

-----------------

**Note:** To use the mod on a **server**, you must set the **level-type** setting in your server's config file to **BIOMESOP**

Also, if you want to **disable or add certain world generation features** in certain biomes, check out our guide for creating **biome configuration files**: https://github.com/Glitchfiend/BiomesOPlenty/wiki/Configuring-Biomes

-----------------

**Overworld biomes and our modded blocks/items have been finalised, Nether biomes have not yet been implemented however they are on the TODO list.**

We've partnered with **CreeperHost**, and will be launching an **official Glitchfiend server** soon(TM), with all of our mods installed. In the meantime, feel free to use this **promo code** when ordering a server of your own!
